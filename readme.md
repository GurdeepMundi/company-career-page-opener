## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the `company_career_page_opener.py` script.
2. Create a file named `career_websites_list.txt` and add the URLs of tech companies' career pages, each on a new line.
3. Make sure the `career_websites_list.txt` file is in the same directory as the `company_career_page_opener.py` script.

## Usage
